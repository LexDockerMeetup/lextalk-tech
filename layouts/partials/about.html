<p itemprop="description">LexTalk Tech is a quarterly conference in Lexington KY.</p>

<p>
This unconference is scheduled to be an hour or two, broken up into 4 - 15 min slots,
2 - 30 min slots where one of them is a panel or Q&A session. The structure will
be very loose, but will be a good format to start. Over time the community will drive
changes they want.
